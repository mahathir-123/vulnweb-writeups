# ðŸš¨ Exploiting Vulnweb â€“ Reflected XSS on `index.php`

## ðŸ§  Description

While exploring [Vulnweb](https://testphp.vulnweb.com), I encountered a **reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability on the `index.php` page. After clicking the first link on the homepage, I noticed a **search bar** that accepts user input.

To test for XSS, I injected a simple payload into the search input field:

```html
<script>alert(8)</script>
